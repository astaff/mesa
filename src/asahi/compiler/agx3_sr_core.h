 * AGX3 special-register read encoder (get_sr -> rld, source-kind f23=7).
 *
 * A special-register read is an async producer: it signals a scoreboard slot
 * (f12) and its consumers carry wait bits, exactly like a device load. The SR
 * number goes in f21; the width class (16- or 32-bit destination) in f10,
 * mirrored in f24. The compact 4-byte form (ep0) cannot carry wait bits or a
 * wide destination; the encoder escalates to the 8-byte form (ep1) when the
 * composer refuses ep0 -- the same mechanical escalation visible in Apple's
 * own emissions. Only (SR, width) pairs witnessed in the corpus encode; the
 * rest fail closed. Grade A: reproduces all 306 clean Apple SR-read witnesses
 * byte-exactly via the composer.
