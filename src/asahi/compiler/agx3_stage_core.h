 * Writers for the AGX3 *staging* register file.
 *
 * `movmsk`, `depthf`, `uvsw` and the texture coordinate operand do not name a
 * general register. Their operand field is selected by the destination-class
 * selector f9 = 5, and it indexes a separate file that only a small set of
 * instructions can write. agx3_tex_core has carried one such writer since the
 * sampler work (the coordinate `copy`); this header collects the whole family
 * so the coverage/depth writeout path can reach it too.
 *
 * The destination-class selector is shared by every AGX3 form:
 *
 *   f9 = 2  general register, index in f2, plus the one-bit hint f11
 *   f9 = 3  uniform / IOTO destination, index in f3
 *   f9 = 4  thread-parameter-store spill slot, index in f4
 *   f9 = 5  staging register, index in f5, with kill f13 and slot f12
 *
 * A staging write is asynchronous: it takes a scoreboard slot (f12) that the
 * consuming writeout instruction waits on. That is why `copy`, `ldimm.ep2` and
 * the staging `clr` all carry f12 while their general-register siblings do not.
 *
 * Evidence (G17P / AGX3b, offline `applegpu-nt -arch applegpu_g17p`, decoded
 * with the composer that also generates Mesa's own encoder tables):
 *
 *  - `ldimm.ep2` staging form: three distinct witnesses in every Apple vertex
 *    object of apple-g17p-isa.metalar, e.g. `0c 80 23 3e 00 00 00 0c 40 20`
 *    = staging[0] <- 0x3F800000 on slot 2, and the discard constant
 *    `0c 80 23 fe 1c 0c ff 0f 40 00` = staging[0] <- 0xFFFFFF00 on slot 1.
 *  - staging `clr`: `1b 00 20 04` = staging[2] <- 0, slot 1 (vmain).
 *  - general `clr`: `0b 00 00 00` / `1b 00 00 00` / `2b 00 00 00` /
 *    `3b 00 00 00` = r0/r2/r4/r6 <- 0 (uint4(0) store probe).
 *
 * AGX3c has all three forms but no witness, so every entry point here refuses
 * anything but AGX3b rather than guessing the longer encoding's constants.
