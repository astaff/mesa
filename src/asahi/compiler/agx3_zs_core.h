 * AGX3 coverage / depth-stencil writeout encoders: `movmsk` and `depthf`.
 *
 * These are the AGX3 counterparts of AGX2's `sample_mask` and `zs_emit`. Both
 * are six bytes on AGX3b and eight on AGX3c, and both have the same shape: one
 * register operand naming the staged writeout word, a kill bit on it, the
 * scoreboard slot the instruction takes, and the per-slot wait mask -- plus,
 * for `depthf`, the depth/stencil enable pair.
 *
 * AGX2 spells both instructions with *two* operands (sample_mask's target and
 * live masks; zs_emit's sample mask and z/s value). AGX3 carries a single
 * register, and every Apple witness stages it with an asynchronous `copy` or
 * `ldimm` immediately before. What that register must contain is therefore a
 * separate contract from the encoding, and only part of it is grounded; see
 * agx3_pack_binary.c for exactly which IR shapes are routed here and which
 * stay refused.
 *
 * Operand roles, and the evidence for each:
 *
 *  - f9 = 5 selects the 13-bit operand field f5. Baseline in every witness of
 *    both mnemonics on both encodings.
 *  - f5 = the staged word's half-register index. Established by def-use, not
 *    by correlation: the corpus `discard_msaa4` shader contains two `movmsk`
 *    instructions, at f5=0 (defined by `ldimm r0` immediately before) and
 *    f5=2 (defined by `copy r1 <- r2`). The same 13-bit field with the same
 *    f9=5 selector is a half-register operand in the independently grounded
 *    `uvsw` and `copy` forms (agx3_vary_core, agx3_tex_core).
 *  - f13 = kill (last use) on that operand, as on uvsw's value. It is 1 in
 *    every 1x witness and 0 in the 4x depth witness, matching a liveness bit
 *    rather than a constant.
 *  - f12 = the scoreboard slot, through the encoder LUT the composer applies.
 *  - f17..f22 (AGX3b) / f17..f24 (AGX3c) = the per-slot wait mask, one bit per
 *    slot starting at slot 1, exactly as agx3_pixel_core spells it for pixrel.
 *  - depthf f25 / f26 = depth written / stencil written; AGX3c additionally
 *    carries the redundant mode selector f35 (1 depth, 2 stencil, 3 both).
 *
 * Every field that no role names is left at the baseline the composer's own
 * strict check requires, so a wrong value cannot silently produce a
 * valid-looking instruction.
 *
 * Derived from Apple's tile, depth/stencil, discard and sample-mask compiler
 * output.
